v0.89
-----

* New ability to list all objects from all namespaces can fail or return
  incomplete results when not all OSDs have been upgraded.  Features
  rados --all ls, rados cppool, rados export, rados cache-flush-evict-all
  and rados cache-try-flush-evict-all can also fail or return incomplete
  results.


v0.90
-----

* There is a new version of the librados watch/notify API with vastly
  improved semantics.  Any applications using this interface are
  encouraged to migrate to the new API.  The old API calls are marked
  as deprecated and will eventually be removed.

* The librados rados_unwatch() call used to be safe to call on an
  invalid handle.  The new version has undefined behavior when passed
  a bogus value (for example, when rados_watch() returns an error and
  handle is not defined).
